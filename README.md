## What is the Qubic Association?

The Qubic Association is a proposed legal entity that will enable Qubic to operate securely and efficiently within the global legal framework. By incorporating as a non-profit association in Switzerland, it will serve as a foundational structure to manage partnerships, grants, marketing, operations, and legal compliance.  

Without this association, doxxed Qubic representatives face significant risks, including personal liability and limited ability to sign contracts or interact with tier 1 exchanges, top market makers, crypto partnerships, academia partnerships, institutional partnerships, and top-tier talent.  

---

## Why is the Qubic Association Necessary?

### Legal and Financial Safety:
- Currently, individuals representing Qubic may bear personal liability for the project’s operational and financial activities, including any regulatory or contractual matters.  
- Forming the Association will shift operational liability onto a recognized legal entity, safeguarding individuals from personal financial or legal risks.  
- The Association will serve as the primary vehicle through which Qubic Core Service members are compensated, ensuring a clear organizational structure for payroll and financial administration.  

### Enabling Ecosystem Growth:
- The Association provides a formal platform to negotiate and enter into legally binding agreements with external parties.  
- It will facilitate hiring, contracting, and partnering with key market participants, including tier-one exchanges, market makers, academic institutions, and other strategic partners critical to the project’s early-stage growth and adoption.  

### Transparency and Decentralization:
- Financial operations of the Association will be conducted via a publicly visible wallet, ensuring transparency for Quorum and the Qubic community.  
- The Association will not govern or control Qubic’s core protocol; it exists solely as a support and service entity. Decentralization and technological independence remain intact.  

### Regulatory Compliance:
- As the global regulatory environment evolves, the Association will ensure Qubic’s adherence to tax, AML, KYC, and other legal requirements.  
- Compliance will help secure listing opportunities on reputable exchanges, attract senior talent, and foster stable, long-term growth.

## What is the scope of the Qubic Association?

### Mission:
The Association’s primary mission is to foster the adoption and ecosystem growth of Qubic’s decentralized technologies. Within its mandate, it will:  
- Support research and development via grants and incubator programs.  
- Manage relationships with exchanges, market makers, educational institutions, NGOs, and corporate partners.  
- Promote community-driven innovation, marketing initiatives, and educational outreach, without exerting control over the Qubic protocol itself.  

### Key Areas of Focus:

#### Ecosystem Development:
- Administer grants and incubation programs for developers and affiliated projects.  
- Build and maintain strategic alliances with industry participants.  

#### Marketing:
- Execute and coordinate global marketing campaigns, events, and branding initiatives.  
- Engage with stakeholders and potential ecosystem contributors.  

#### Operations, Finance, and Strategy:
- Oversee administrative and financial activities, including contract management, financial record-keeping, and infrastructure support.  
- Align operational initiatives with Qubic’s broader strategic objectives.  

### Independence from the Protocol:
- The Association will not oversee or control the Qubic protocol, the core technology, smart contracts, or the initiatives of the protocol’s founder, Come-from-Beyond.  
- All protocol-level decisions and technical developments remain decentralized and independent of the Association’s governance.  
- The Association’s funding remains subject to approval through the CCF, ensuring community-driven oversight and accountability.

## What Are the Risks Without the Association?

### Personal Liability:
- Without a legal entity, Qubic representatives could be held personally liable for debts, taxes, contractual disputes, and other operational issues.  

### Limited Partnerships:
- Without a formal structure, Qubic cannot easily enter into legally binding contracts, hold assets, or engage at the highest levels of the crypto and institutional ecosystem.  
- The absence of a recognized entity has already hindered the ability to secure favorable terms with top-tier exchanges and market makers.  

### Regulatory and Reputational Risks:
- Operating without a recognized legal wrapper may lead to non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, increasing the risk of regulatory enforcement, exchange delistings, and misuse of the $QUBIC ticker.  
- Negative events occurring in an unstructured environment could damage Qubic’s credibility and growth prospects.  

---

## How Will Risks Be Managed?

To protect the Association, its board members, and affiliated parties, the following measures will be implemented:  

- **Liability Insurance (D&O Insurance):** Covers board members against claims arising from good-faith decisions made in their official capacity.  
- **Indemnification Clauses:** The Association’s statutes will include clauses to indemnify board members who act within their mandates and in good faith.  
- **Internal Controls:** Robust KYC/AML procedures and governance rules will help prevent illegal activities and ensure ongoing compliance.  
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** All board decisions will be recorded, promoting transparency and demonstrating due diligence.  
- **Litigation Fund:** An allocated reserve will finance any necessary legal defenses, relieving board members of personal financial exposure.  
- **Clear Role Definition:** The Association will emphasize its role as a service entity independent from the decentralized protocol, reducing the risk of blurred responsibilities and liabilities.

## Why Switzerland?

### Advantages of Swiss Jurisdiction:
- **Supportive Regulatory Environment:** Switzerland is known for its favorable conditions for blockchain-related projects.  
- **Organizational Flexibility:** Associations are adaptable legal structures that can evolve alongside the needs of decentralized ecosystems.  
- **No Mandatory Capital Requirement:** Associations do not require a minimum capital investment, making them cost-effective compared to foundations.  
- **Global Recognition:** Switzerland’s strong reputation for crypto-related governance can enhance the Association’s credibility and standing.  

### Why Not a Foundation?

#### Foundations vs. Associations:
- **Flexibility:** Foundations are rigid and expensive to modify once their purpose is set. Associations allow for greater adaptability as the project’s needs evolve.  
- **Cost Considerations:** Foundations require a minimum of 50,000 CHF for registration. Associations have no such requirement, reducing initial overhead.  
- **Decentralized Governance:** Foundations often centralize decision-making, while an association’s flexible structure aligns better with Qubic’s decentralized ethos.  


#### Why Not use a Nominee Director in Singapore, BVA or Seychelles?
- Switzerland offers a robust and reputable crypto regulatory framework. It shows we are a serious project with a long term view of building a sustainable entity.  
- The Association with its flexibility only exists in Switzerland. Many existing crypto projects choose Switzerland due to Crypto Valley and it’s network, the legal framework for crypto, tax benefits and you can pay in crypto. 
- It's difficult to bank when you are from an off-shore location. Banks are opposed to nominee directors due to 3rd party risk and lack of transparency. 
- Switzerland has an open commercial registry which can confirm the good standing of the entity which can lead to good comfort for VCs and other investors. 
- You run the risk that operations do not run smoothly because the structure is "hidden"and uses director nominees that oversee multiple other companies.

## Board Members and Board Fees

Members of ecosystem teams and of the community that are interested in becoming a board member are very welcome to apply to the QCS Committee. The QCS board should be a reflection of the Qubic ecosystem so it helps serve the best interests of Qubic and the community. Applicants need to be familiar with the tasks and legal responsibilities that come with a board member role. 


### Initial Board Composition:
- **Alber (Lead Ecosystem)**  
- **Talentnodes (Lead Operations)**  
- **Dr. Lorez (Legal Counsel)**  

## 2025 Board Expansion and beyond:

In 2025, two additional board members will be added for enhanced governance and strategic advisory support:  
- **Daniel Diez** (Head of Incubation EMEA, Accenture)  
- **Zgirt** (Qubic Core Services)  

The Association may gradually add 1-2 more board members over time, ensuring a balanced, cost-efficient, and robust governance structure as Qubic grows.


### Board Fees:
- (Active) Board members have extra governance tasks and face legal, financial and reputational risks. Compensation in Qubic reflects these responsibilities and follows industry standards. The pay-out is done on a quarterly basis in Qubic.For more information regarding the specific tasks and responsibilities of a board member, check out the FAQ.

## FAQs

**What is the Scope of Qubic Association?**
The scope of the Qubic Association focuses on ecosystem growth and development. The Association will not oversee the core technology, oversee or control the Qubic protocol, smart contracts, or the initiatives of the protocol’s founder, Come-from-Beyond.All protocol-level decisions and technical developments remain decentralized and independent of the Association’s governance.
The Association’s funding remains subject to approval through the CCF, ensuring community-driven oversight and accountability. 

**If it is for having contracts with T1, MM and so on, what hinders us to create a "cheap" company in specific country?** 
Switzerland offers a robust and reputable crypto regulatory framework. It shows we are serious. The Association with its flexibility only exists in Switzerland. There's a reason why many existing crypto projects choose Switzerland. We all are familiar with Crypto Valley. As mentioned in the proposal. Individuals that represent Qubic are at this point personally liable if things go wrong. It's much easier to bank when you are from a non off-shore location. Banks are opposed to nominee directors as such due to 3rd party risk and in transparency. Switzerland has an open commercial registry which can confirm the good standing of the entity which can lead to good comfort for VCs and other investors. 

**Couldn't this help to decrease the risk of the members? they wouldn't even have to be named publicly **
Yes it could de-risk but you are less credible as an entity. You run the risk that operations does not run smooth because the structure is "hidden"and uses director nominees that oversee multiple other companies . Director nominees are also not really board members and add no value besides signing papers. 

**Before i even would think to vote yes to such a plan, i would want to see the articles of association (example: https://members.cryptovalley.swiss/page/our-statutes [i didn't read it, no idea if it is good or not, just the first result in a google search]) **
Yes that's coming tomorrow. Karin, our legal counsel, is drafting them as we speak. 

**Double compensation e.g. QCS and board member is for me a no go; if so, better find other members which also bring other views to qubic**
It's industry standard in crypto companies to have executive board members who are also employees so they bridge the gap between what's going on in the company and oversee governance together with board member that are non employees. Now a personal note, for me this is a pain in the neck and the compensation would just be a disaster fund in case shit hits the fan, so I'm more than happy if someone wants to step in and be in this position. As you can see in the proposal we asked Karin Lorez to join as a board member whom you've met. She's a top crypto lawyer in Switzerland who has licensed the first cryptobank in Switzerland, helped advice countless other projects and has great connections to FINMA and other regulators. We also present Daniel, who is the head of innovation at Accenture. He's in crypto since 2013, helped countless other crypto projects and has been building tech companies himself his entire life. Finally, I've been told that we also asked you. You said you were open for it depending on the scope of the Association, is this scope ok with you? You would be a great addition to the board. If the Association proposal will not be approved, we will recommend Quorum to recruit new committee members for QCS/SteCo who are willing to take the legal risk so me and TN don't have to be public anymore. Unless someone comes up with a feasible solution short term approved by Karin

**Does the budget break down include the two members planed to join in 2025 or would you request another budget for them?**
No the budget includes 3 board members who's compensation are evenIy split. We would request another budget for the additional two board members in 2025 to relieve pressure on the CCF. 6) because the board member fee is not a salary, i would want to know the exact amount each of the members receive The board fee is 80,000 CHF per year or $90,560 per year 


**I could provide a domicile address for 0 chf?**
We would prefer to have a domicile address in Zug, Crypto Valley which is also tax friendly. If you can provide a domicile in Zug would be a great help. It might also be better to work with parties that are independent from Qubic so that in case of dispute, the Association still has access.  

**What does the position "cost incorporation" include? to fund an association in switzerland basically is for free.** 
The $9100 is an estimate. It includes the Article of the Association that need to be written (we're paying for the drafts in advance), government needs to be paid and there are lawyer fees that need to be paid. 

**What litigation do we expect that we reserve 11.4k$?** 
It's common in the industry to save up a litigation fund that's only used in case the Qubic Association is sued. These fees can go up quickly depending on with what regulator we deal with. If not managed correctly as Karin mentioned above, it can go into the millions when dealing with the US government (we are going to make Qubic available for US customers through new exchanges) (edited)

**Why is the Association Needed Now?**
As Qubic’s scope and ambitions grow, operating without a formal legal entity poses significant barriers to securing partnerships, ensuring compliance, and protecting individuals involved. The Association provides a structured, legally recognized entity that can advance Qubic’s objectives responsibly and sustainably.

**What is the Litigation Fund?**
This reserve is allocated to cover any legal disputes or challenges that may arise, ensuring that neither the Association nor its board members bear undue personal financial burdens.

**What are the tasks of a board member**
Active Board members have additional tasks in addition to their normal work. These tasks include:
- Fiduciary Duty
- Act in the best interest of the organization, its ecosystem, and stakeholders.
- Prioritize ethical decision-making and avoid conflicts of interest.
- Compliance with Laws and Regulations
- Ensure the organization complies with relevant global regulations, including securities laws, AML/KYC rules, and tax obligations.
- Oversee proper registration and legal frameworks
- Risk Oversight
- Develop and monitor risk management frameworks for:
- Smart contract vulnerabilities and security risks.
- Legal, financial, and operational risks.
- Respond swiftly to emerging threats.
- Token and Treasury Oversight

**Management of the Association's assets;**
- Oversee vesting schedules, liquidity management, and token-based compensation.
- Preparation of the budget and annual accounts;
- Ensuring Transparency
- Deliver transparent reports on operations, finances, and major initiatives.
- Ensure all decisions are documented and shared with stakeholders (e.g., via governance proposals).
- Supporting Decentralization
- Create governance structures that encourage decentralized decision-making.
- Promote open, community-led processes (e.g., quorum voting, proposal submissions).
- Representing the Association to the public;
- Legal representation of the Association in case of litigation.
- Represent Qubic for communication with regulators and other administrative functions.
- Preparation of the General Assembly;
- Execution of the resolutions of the General Assembly;
- Decision on the admission and possible exclusion of members of the Association;
- Handling of suggestions, applications and complaints of the members of the Association;
- Activities related to the fulfillment of the purpose of the Association;

**What are the potential risks for a board member?**
- Board members are exposed to considerable legal risk and reputational risk as the crypto landscape is not thoroughly regulated. Board members will need to legally represent the Association in case Qubic gets sued..
- Board members may be held accountable for breaches of securities laws, tax regulations, or AML policies.
- Regulatory ambiguity around token classification and DAOs may expose board members to unforeseen liabilities.
- Without a legal wrapper (e.g., a foundation or association), board members can be personally liable for organizational actions
- Mismanagement of treasury funds or failure to mitigate token volatility could lead to reputational and financial damage.
- Legal or regulatory fines can impact organizational stability and expose board members.
- Mismanagement of partnerships, listings, or ecosystem programs could harm the project’s reputation.

Board member compensation is an industry standard. Industry benchmark is between $75k-$150k annually. The pay-out is on a quarterly basis in Qubic.

**Do all QCS members receive a salary?**
Out of the 5 committee members, Alber, Talentnodes and Zgirt receive a salary. Karin is currently not a QCS member but receives legal fees for the legal advice/work she provides.

**So what would be the complete salary then? QCS and association combined, and what part are for the legal services?**
I don’t feel comfortable singling out salaries but the average between these three salaries is about 8k a month. This is much less in comparison with salaries from other protocols at a similar size. Keep in mind these individuals are also not employees, have no benefits or legal protection at this point. They also have no large Qubic bags. Becoming a board members comes with additional responsibilities and legal/reputional risks.

**If the association is sued. Why/how are members affected?**
Board members are affected as they represent the association. They will not be financially liable unless there's gross misconduct. Members of the GA are not affected. 
if we do pay an MM, and they manipulate the market lets say. How does it implicate members of the Association? 
Board members may not be legally liable for let's say holding a price level under Swiss law. However, this situation might change depending on the jurisdiction.


**Why Is an Association Necessary Compared to Historical Examples (e.g., TAO)?**
Market conditions, regulatory expectations, and the complexity of current initiatives differ from earlier efforts. The Association’s formation is a direct response to today’s environment, where stringent compliance, professional governance, and robust legal frameworks are essential to achieve Tier 1 listings, secure high-profile partnerships, and realize Qubic’s long-term vision.

**What other web3 projects have incorporated a legal entity?**
Many other projects incorporated legal entities like the Ethereum Foundation or the Solana Foundation. Here’s an article describing the announcement of the Solana Foundation: https://solana.com/news/announcing-the-formation-of-the-solana-foundation

**How are board members replaced?**
The Quorum has the authority to remove board members at any time through a simple majority vote, ensuring that leadership remains effective and accountable. The Association follows the same governance guidelines shared by the approved SteCo Term Proposal.
If a member or members of the Qubic Association decide not to follow instructions of the Quorum, they are in breach of their existing contract as an elected representative. Quorum can decide to take legal action as a consequence.  

**How are new board members selected?**
Members of the General Assembly represent the current QCS Committee. New board members are to be interviewed and selected by members of the Qubic Association. Once a board member has been selected, the Quorum will give their final approval through a proposal.

**Will the Qubic Association represent Qubic?**
The Qubic Association is the legal wrapper around Qubic Core Services.The Association’s primary mission is to foster the adoption and ecosystem growth of Qubic’s decentralized technologies. The Association will not oversee or control the Qubic protocol, the core technology, smart contracts, or the initiatives of the protocol’s founder, Come-from-Beyond. All protocol-level decisions and technical developments remain decentralized and independent of the Association’s governance. For more information about the scope of the Qubic Core Services Team, check out the approved SteCo term proposal: https://github.com/Foleycious/Steco-Term-Proposal 

**Wouldn't it be a good idea to fill these roles with people that do it for intrinsic motivation only so that only a small salary and compensation is needed? or would that not be enough for the tasks at hand?**
If we find qualified doxxed people who are willing to do it against a small fee, we are very welcoming to that idea. We reached out to various individuals but they are not interested. Board members have additional tasks, responsibilities and are exposed to risks that normal members would not be exposed to. 

**Is it legally possible to be sure the Association will always follow quorum decisions?**
QCS members are elected by Quorum to represent Qubic and the best interests of Qubic. If members of the Association decide not to follow instructions of the Quorum, it means they are in breach of their agreement. As a consequence the Quorum may decide to pursue legal action.   

**How long does it take to incorporate the Association?**
We can incorporate it within 1-2 weeks if we’re fast.

**How will this affect the listings currently slotted in Q4?**
We can sign with an association in formation.

**I don't see any link between Qubic protocol and a legal entity. Let's just say Talentnodes is a board member of that entity and he fully control the fund. One day the Quorum wants to remove Talentnodes but he resists and threaten to take all of the fund. What can computors/quorum do in that situation?**
If members of the Association decide not to follow instructions of the Quorum, it means they are in breach of their agreement. As a consequence the Quorum may decide to pursue legal action. 

There are plenty of corporations that will bind to the association after it running for a while, for example: mm contracts, T1 future listings, etc... Quorum can't just let them die out the blue.
In case members or Board members of the association are dismissed, a hand-over will need to take place either through existing board members or an interim board member elected by Quorum. 

**Given that the scope of work remains unchanged compared to the QCS mission (as stated above), will these changes in organizational structure impact future QCS funding proposals? For example, will salary positions for Association board members be removed from the QCS budget, or do the new requirements simply justify, in your view, a pay raise? (This might very well be the case, but I would ask for a clear justification.**
Board members do not receive a salary but rather compensation for the additional tasks, responsibilities, risks and reputational exposure. This compensation ceases when they are no longer part of the board and is independent of any salary from QCS.

W**hy does this require a new organizational entity with its own budget and structure rather than being incorporated into the existing QCS structure, thereby decreasing complexity? For instance, could the Association become part of the QCS, or vice versa?**
The association is a legal and operational tool for QCS. All payments would be made through the association.

As funds are pre-allocated for the entire year, what would happen in the event of significant price fluctuations? Would additional funding be required in case of price decreases, or would surplus QUs be returned if the budget could be fulfilled with fewer resources? Alternatively, are all QUs converted into USD or CHF and deposited in a Swiss bank account? There are, in fact, specialized accounts for associations in Switzerland that could incorporate additional security measures, such as requiring multiple signers for larger transactions.
Regarding treasury, it would be managed in QUBIC, stable coins, and CHF. For Qubic, a multi-signature solution is being developed, and for stable coins, we would use multisign with Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe). its an audited entity, so all will be transparent. If price rises, the budget can be rolled over and reduces or eliminates future request. Salaries are fixed in USD, so Qubic rate will always be adapted. Treasury needs a strategy to survive bear market, e.g. some qubics, some CHF, some USD imo, tbd. If it get to insane numbers (unlikely with the 70 bn budget), quorum can request it back or ask to use it for other activities.


On that note, it would actually be beneficial to have a finalized "Articles of Association" document. This is a fundamental requirement for the Association, as it would outline liabilities, organizational structures, and—most importantly—the relationship with the Quorum as a governing body (if this is indeed possible). Such a document would be instrumental in providing clarity and transparency before allocating a significant budget to the Association.
The Articles of the Association can be found in the Discord. 

**Can a Board Member be a delegate?**
Yes but not necessarily. For example Karin and Dani are not QCS committee members and thus not a member of the Association if they join as a board member. Only QCS (previous SteCo) are members of the association as it mimics the current setup. Yes they are as it shows the important relationship between the Association and Quorum. Board members and members are bound to decisions from Quotum bc they have been elected to do so. There’s a agreement to do so after the approval of the latest steco term. That’s the legal guidance that we received from our legal counsel

**How can a quorum be a legal organ if its members (computers) are anonymous and lack legal accountability**
Gm, it's not an organ as per law. We put them there to integrate. For example, the advisory committee is not an organ per law either, they advise.
