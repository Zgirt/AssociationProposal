## What is the Qubic Association?

The Qubic Association is a proposed legal entity that will enable Qubic to operate securely and efficiently within the global legal framework. By incorporating as a non-profit association in Switzerland, it will serve as a foundational structure to manage partnerships, grants, marketing, operations, and legal compliance.  

Without this association, doxxed Qubic representatives face significant risks, including personal liability and limited ability to sign contracts or interact with tier 1 exchanges, top market makers, crypto partnerships, academia partnerships, institutional partnerships, and top-tier talent.  

---

## Why is the Qubic Association Necessary?

### Legal and Financial Safety:
- Currently, individuals representing Qubic may bear personal liability for the project’s operational and financial activities, including any regulatory or contractual matters.  
- Forming the Association will shift operational liability onto a recognized legal entity, safeguarding individuals from personal financial or legal risks.  
- The Association will serve as the primary vehicle through which Qubic Core Service members are compensated, ensuring a clear organizational structure for payroll and financial administration.  

### Enabling Ecosystem Growth:
- The Association provides a formal platform to negotiate and enter into legally binding agreements with external parties.  
- It will facilitate hiring, contracting, and partnering with key market participants, including tier-one exchanges, market makers, academic institutions, and other strategic partners critical to the project’s early-stage growth and adoption.  

### Transparency and Decentralization:
- Financial operations of the Association will be conducted via a publicly visible wallet, ensuring transparency for Quorum and the Qubic community.  
- The Association will not govern or control Qubic’s core protocol; it exists solely as a support and service entity. Decentralization and technological independence remain intact.  

### Regulatory Compliance:
- As the global regulatory environment evolves, the Association will ensure Qubic’s adherence to tax, AML, KYC, and other legal requirements.  
- Compliance will help secure listing opportunities on reputable exchanges, attract senior talent, and foster stable, long-term growth.

## What is the scope of the Qubic Association?

### Mission:
The Association’s primary mission is to foster the adoption and ecosystem growth of Qubic’s decentralized technologies. Within its mandate, it will:  
- Support research and development via grants and incubator programs.  
- Manage relationships with exchanges, market makers, educational institutions, NGOs, and corporate partners.  
- Promote community-driven innovation, marketing initiatives, and educational outreach, without exerting control over the Qubic protocol itself.  

### Key Areas of Focus:

#### Ecosystem Development:
- Administer grants and incubation programs for developers and affiliated projects.  
- Build and maintain strategic alliances with industry participants.  

#### Marketing:
- Execute and coordinate global marketing campaigns, events, and branding initiatives.  
- Engage with stakeholders and potential ecosystem contributors.  

#### Operations, Finance, and Strategy:
- Oversee administrative and financial activities, including contract management, financial record-keeping, and infrastructure support.  
- Align operational initiatives with Qubic’s broader strategic objectives.  

### Independence from the Protocol:
- The Association will not oversee or control the Qubic protocol, the core technology, smart contracts, or the initiatives of the protocol’s founder, Come-from-Beyond.  
- All protocol-level decisions and technical developments remain decentralized and independent of the Association’s governance.  
- The Association’s funding remains subject to approval through the CCF, ensuring community-driven oversight and accountability.

## What Are the Risks Without the Association?

### Personal Liability:
- Without a legal entity, Qubic representatives could be held personally liable for debts, taxes, contractual disputes, and other operational issues.  

### Limited Partnerships:
- Without a formal structure, Qubic cannot easily enter into legally binding contracts, hold assets, or engage at the highest levels of the crypto and institutional ecosystem.  
- The absence of a recognized entity has already hindered the ability to secure favorable terms with top-tier exchanges and market makers.  

### Regulatory and Reputational Risks:
- Operating without a recognized legal wrapper may lead to non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, increasing the risk of regulatory enforcement, exchange delistings, and misuse of the $QUBIC ticker.  
- Negative events occurring in an unstructured environment could damage Qubic’s credibility and growth prospects.

## How Will Risks Be Managed?

To protect the Association, its board members, and affiliated parties, the following measures will be implemented:  

- **Liability Insurance (D&O Insurance):** Covers board members against claims arising from good-faith decisions made in their official capacity.  
- **Indemnification Clauses:** The Association’s statutes will include clauses to indemnify board members who act within their mandates and in good faith.  
- **Internal Controls:** Robust KYC/AML procedures and governance rules will help prevent illegal activities and ensure ongoing compliance.  
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** All board decisions will be recorded, promoting transparency and demonstrating due diligence.  
- **Litigation Fund:** An allocated reserve will finance any necessary legal defenses, relieving board members of personal financial exposure.  
- **Clear Role Definition:** The Association will emphasize its role as a service entity independent from the decentralized protocol, reducing the risk of blurred responsibilities and liabilities.

## Why Switzerland?

### Advantages of Swiss Jurisdiction:
- **Supportive Regulatory Environment:** Switzerland is known for its favorable conditions for blockchain-related projects.  
- **Organizational Flexibility:** Associations are adaptable legal structures that can evolve alongside the needs of decentralized ecosystems.  
- **No Mandatory Capital Requirement:** Associations do not require a minimum capital investment, making them cost-effective compared to foundations.  
- **Global Recognition:** Switzerland’s strong reputation for crypto-related governance can enhance the Association’s credibility and standing.  

### Why Not a Foundation?

#### Foundations vs. Associations:
- **Flexibility:** Foundations are rigid and expensive to modify once their purpose is set. Associations allow for greater adaptability as the project’s needs evolve.  
- **Cost Considerations:** Foundations require a minimum of 50,000 CHF for registration. Associations have no such requirement, reducing initial overhead.  
- **Decentralized Governance:** Foundations often centralize decision-making, while an association’s flexible structure aligns better with Qubic’s decentralized ethos.

## Board Members and Board Fees

### Initial Board Composition:
- **Alber (Lead Ecosystem)**  
- **Talentnodes (Lead Operations)**  
- **Dr. Lorez (Legal Counsel)**  

### Board Fees:
- Board members face reputational, legal, and financial risks. Compensation in both fiat (or stablecoins) and Qubic tokens reflects these responsibilities and provides fair incentives. Benchmarks against comparable Web3 organizations will guide compensation packages.

## Future Board Expansion

In 2025, two additional board members will be added for enhanced governance and strategic advisory support:  
- **Daniel Diez** (Head of Incubation EMEA, Accenture)  
- **Zgirt** (Qubic Core Services)  

The Association may gradually add 1-2 more board members over time, ensuring a balanced, cost-efficient, and robust governance structure as Qubic grows.

Market conditions, regulatory expectations, and the complexity of current initiatives differ from earlier efforts. The Association’s formation is a direct response to today’s environment, where stringent compliance, professional governance, and robust legal frameworks are essential to achieve Tier 1 listings, secure high-profile partnerships, and realize Qubic’s long-term vision.
